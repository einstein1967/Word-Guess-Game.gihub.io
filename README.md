Choose letters to complete the puzzle before the hangman graphic is complete. You lose after 10 incorrect guesses.

This was early on in our bootcamp and much of it was challenging. From getting the letters to pop up in the right place on the grid to cycling thru the image slides to determing if the player won or lost and what to do about it. Those challenges at the time also mean that this is one of the apps I'm most proud of since I eventually got almost every part to work the way I wanted it to. Much of the code represents a first for me in any assignment.
